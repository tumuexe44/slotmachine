Slot Machine

This project is a simple text-based slot machine game implemented in Python. Players can place bets, spin the reels, and win payouts based on the results. The game is designed to provide an engaging and interactive experience while demonstrating basic programming concepts such as functions, loops, and conditionals.

Features:
Random Symbol Generation: The game uses randomization to simulate spinning the slot machine.
User Interaction: Players can place bets, view their current balance, and decide whether to continue playing.
Payout System: The game includes a payout system that rewards players based on the symbols matched.
Input Validation: Ensures that the player's bets are valid and that they have sufficient funds.
Game Over State: The game ends when the player chooses not to continue or runs out of balance.
This project is a fun way to learn Python programming and can be further expanded with additional features such as more symbols, different payout rules, or a graphical user interface.
